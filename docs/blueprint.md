# Demo-Barber — Blueprint (Boilerplate v1.0)

## Purpose

Demo-Barber is a **production-ready boilerplate** for Framixor client websites.
It is not a demo, not a playground, and not a per-client customization space.

The goal is to:

- Deliver premium websites with strong governance
- Enable fast, repeatable client onboarding
- Prevent template erosion over time

---

## Core Principle

**One boilerplate. One client per repository. Zero custom logic inside the template.**

Any customization happens via:

- Contracts (JSON)
- Assets
- Environment configuration

Never via layout changes.

## High-Level Architecture (Floor Plan)
